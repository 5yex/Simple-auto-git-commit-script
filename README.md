# Git-Auto-Commit-Script
Simple script I use to synchronize a repository of non-serious projects and junk from my programming experiments, without having to worry about commits.   Or rather, a good bad breadbasket for using git. But it works better than gdrive's synchronized folders. Especially if you want to be carefree.


## Start the script in Windows, but hidden:
(.vbs script)
``` [vbs]
set objshell = createobject("wscript.shell")
objshell.run "GitAutoUpdate",vbhide
```
